Welcome! I’m JonathanYS (also known as JonathanDY and JDY), and this is my personal blog where I share my journey and insights in various fields, with a particular focus on Software Development and Cybersecurity.

While I’m not an expert in these areas, I am deeply passionate about learning and sharing knowledge in an accessible way. My aim is to provide content that is both thorough and well-researched, ensuring that it addresses key questions and challenges. Should you have any questions—whether you’re a novice or more experienced—I welcome them and am eager to research and provide answers.

- I am a student and I love to expand my knowledge in lots of fields.
- I have a deep interest in C/C++ and Python programming languages.
- I’m an enthusiastic participant in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and a fan of security research.
- I have a passion for riddles and problem-solving challenges. If you have any intriguing puzzles or challenges, I will be happy to take part in solving it.


On this blog, you’ll find a range of content including Write-Ups, Proofs of Concept (POCs), and more. My goal is to make complex topics accessible and engaging.

I hope you find something that piques your interest. \
Enjoy your stay!
